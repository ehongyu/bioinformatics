# My old bioinformatics code

Once upon a time, I was a computational biologist (or so called bioinformatician in the biotech industry), and here is some skeleton code I left behind.

Some background: when I was a young college student back in the late last century, we were taught that the 21st century would be the century of biology, just like physics in the 20th century. It sounds so exciting that I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in the computational biology field, and eventually succeeded in working for my dream company Celera Genomics, which successfully mapped the human genome and published the mile-stone paper in journal Science back in 2001. But 20 years later, the crystal ball prediction is not quite accurate yet. We are still far away from curing of cancer, alzheimer or other tough deseases. Eventually I switched to the IT industry. Maybe I will be able to come back to the biotech field in future, and then I probably can pick up something I left here one day.
